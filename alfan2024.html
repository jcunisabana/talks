 The phenomenal properties of experience can be initially characterized as the properties that account for what it is for a person from their own point of view to have such an experience.

Ned Block’s (1993) classic remark: ‘You ask: What is it that philosophers have called qualitative states? I answer, only half in jest: As Louis Armstrong said when asked what jazz is, “If you got to ask, you ain’t never gonna get to know.”’ </p>

Frank Jackson:  Tell me everything physical there is to tell about what is going on in a living brain, the kind of states, their functional role, their relation to what goes on at other times and in other brains, and so on and so forth, and be I as clever as can be in fitting it all together, you won’t have told me about the hurtfulness of pains, the itchiness of itches, pangs of jealousy, or about the characteristic experience of tasting a lemon, smelling a rose, hearing a loud noise or seeing the sky.

    Nonetheless, there is a persistent and prevalent tendency among philosophers to assume that the distinctively first-personal knowledge we have, or can have, of our sensory experiences when we have them has a special and significant role to play when it comes to offering a philosophical account of conscious sensory experience, and that an appeal to introspection and phenomenology is legitimate when theorizing about the nature of such experience in a way it perhaps isn’t when theorizing about thought. (Soteriou 2013, p. 9)</p>
</section>

<section>Relational views of experience claim that the phenomenal character of an experience —what it is like to have that experience—is fundamentally about the relationship between the subject and the objects of experience. These views suggest that introspection reveals this relational nature, where the phenomenal character is not just an internal mental state but is constituted by the direct relation with the world around us. </section>

  <section  data-background-image ="img/Lemon.jpg" data-background-size = "contain" data-background-position="right">

<p class="highlightred doscuadros">This means that the characteristic subjective experience of, for instance, tasting a lemon is to be understood in terms of a perceptual relation one is in with a lemon and its properties.</p>


</section>


  <section  data-background-image ="img/banana.jpg" data-background-size = "contain" data-background-position="right">

<p class="highlightred doscuadros">Because of this the discussion of relational views of experience usually circles around issues about the possibility of hallucination. 

<br>
    The debate seems to be about on the apparently perplexing conclusion that hallucinations and a veridical perceptions as of, say, a banana do not have the same phenomenal properties despite the fact that one cannot introspectively tell them apart. 
</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>
If in a hallucination there seems to be a relation but there is none, how could it be that the perceptual relation to objects and their properties constitutes the phenomenal properties of experience? 

<p class="fragment">
If veridical and hallucinatory experiences cannot be introspectively distinguished and only in the former there is a perceptual relation, how could it be that such relation constitutes the phenomenal character of an experience? What would the character of hallucinations be? </p></section>


<section>To characterize the phenomenal character of an experience in terms of a perceptual relation to objects and properties has the seemingly baffling consequence that introspection, even though we take it to be a source of evidence, is a <em>fallible</em> source of evidence because it fails to reveal the character of hallucinations. 

<p class="fragment">
The debate then is about the aptness of accepting the constitutive claim about the phenomenal character while at the same time taking introspection to have such an important epistemic role. 
</p>
</section>

<section>In this talk I explore a different kind of challenge to relationalism about perceptual experience. 
</section>


<section>

    The challenge arises not from cases where there might not be an object (like in hallucinations) but from phenomenal properties that do not seem to be accountable in terms of a relation to objects and properties. 

<p class="fragment">
This shifts discussion of relational views of perception away from  objects and properties and turns towards structural aspects of perceptual experience. </p></section>


<section>The challenge arises from a question about the nature of bodily perception and the apparently special way in which one experiences one’s own body “from the inside”.  
<p class="fragment"> 
Let me explain.</p></section>
<section>
 Ordinary cases of bodily awareness like that of feeling pain in my jaw involve what seems to be a sense of ownership.

<section>How could a relational view of experience differentiate between the, say, tactile experiences of our own body and the kind of perceptual experience that we have of our own body “from the inside” that includes this apparent sense of ownership?

<p class="fragment">
 How could the phenomenal character of ownership be characterized in terms of the objects and properties that are being perceived?  What experienced property would amount to an experience of ownership of the body?

    <p class="doscuadros fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">    Following Martin (1992, 1993, 1995), the relationalist might say that in so far there is bodily awareness at distinct spatial coordinates there is already a sense of one's own body.

    Many [patients] can still feel pain and even cry out if the examiner pinches their “alien” hand (Melzack, 1990). For instance, one patient asked his doctor:<br>
P: I still have the acute pain where the prosthesis is.<br>
E: Which prosthesis? <br>
P: Don’t you see? This thing here (indicating his left arm). The doctors have attached this tool to my body in order to help me to move [...] Once home could I ask my wife, from time to time, to remove this left arm and put it in the cupboard for a few hours in order to have some relief from pain? (Maravita, 2008, p. 102).<br>

</section>    
  
<section>Some pain experiences of patients with somatoparaphrenia, also known as asomatognosia or alien hand syndrome, purportedly present a counterexample to the relational view of bodily ownership for they seem to constitute cases of bodily sensation at one’s body without a sense of it being one’s own, that is, cases of sensation without ownership.
 <h2 class="fragment">They seem to feel pain as if it were in another person's body!?!?!</h2>

The evidence does not show bodily sensation with <em>complete</em> spatial character. </p>

<p class="">
Let me explain.</p>
</section>    
    
<section>    <p class="">
    To see the incomplete nature of the spatial character of such experiences, we need to tease out two aspects of spatial bodily awareness. </p>
    <p class="fragment doscuadros">
    For even though patients suffering of somatoparaphrenia have <i>some</i> awareness of the spatial properties of their bodily sensations they lack an awareness of <i>other</i> spatial properties. </p></section>   
    
<section>In ordinary cases, there is no question about why a bodily experience is perceived within certain bounds. In these cases, there is a sense that the limits of one’s bodily experience are those of one’s felt body; limits not merely feelt to be the same as of one’s felt body but rather as constituted by it. 

<p class="fragment">
One senses the bounds of possible experience as they are to the extent there is a sense in which the limits are set by one's own body. </p></section>

<section>
Subjects with somatoparaphrenia can be said to lack a sense of ownerhip because they lack a sense of the limits of their possible bodily sensation in the alien hand.     
    
<br> This is an empirical hypothesis that I think would decide the issue in favour or against the Simple view of bodily ownerhip. But the evidence presented by De Vignemont is, I have argued, not enough.

    To conclude:
    The special character of bodily awareness as having a sole object, in contrast to the five traditional senses, might be bit over-emphasized. 
    
    
    <p class="fragment">
    
    Though bodily awareness does not involve identifying one among many possible objects of experience, more than just the body is presented.</p>
    
       <p class="fragment">
    The relationalist can account for spatial bodily awareness of two kinds. We sense the body as the place where a particular sensation is felt: the hand where I feel pain. <span class="fragment"> But we also sense the body as the place where (other) sensations could be felt: the hand where I do not feel pain but where I could. </span>
